# Chocolatey Workshop - Organizational Use

This is the material for the workshop "Managing Organizational Use of Chocolatey" written by Gary Ewan Park and Paul Broadwith.

## Content

Software management and deployment is already a task, getting that good base of infrastructure in place right definitely helps. When you are using Chocolatey for software deployments, there are some recommendations on how to set up repositories and Configuration Management, not to mention how best to set up your production deployment infrastructure for success. Achieving reliability, repeatability, and scale is important in any organization - come let us show you how to easily achieve all of that.

In this workshop you will get hands on experience with:

* Setting up your workstation for Chocolatey packaging (best tools to use)
* Preparing Chocolatey for internal use
* Setting up package repositories (Nexus)
* Self Service Management of Package Installations
* Synchronizing traditionally installed applications with Chocolatey Packages
* Combining Chocolatey with Configuration Management Systems (?)
